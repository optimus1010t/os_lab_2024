/* 							SEMAPHORES
Semaphores are system variables used for process synchronization. You may
think of a semaphore, s, as a variable maintained by the system. A semaphore
can be obtained by a semget() system call. Its initial value can be set by
the semctl() system call. There are two common operations that a process
can perform on a semaphore, s, namely:

	P(s) or wait(s)  :  If the value of s is greater than 0, then
						this operation decrements the value of s and
						the calling process continues. Otherwise, if
						s is 0, then the calling process is blocked on s.

	V(s) or signal(s) : If any process is blocked on s, then this
						unblocks (wakes up) the earliest among the
						processes blocked on s. Otherwise, the value
						of the semaphore is incremented.

In UNIX/Linux, both P(s) and V(s) can be done with the semop() system call
with appropriate parameters.

/* 	We will define the P(s) and V(s) operations in terms of the semop()
	system call. The syntax of semop is as follows:

	->	int semop ( int semid, struct sembuf *sops, unsigned nsops)

	where semid is the semaphore identifier returned by the semget()
	system call. The second parameter is a pointer to a structure whichs
	we must pass. The fields of this structure indicates whether we wish
	to perform a P(s) operation or a V(s) operation. Refer to the system
	manual for the third parameter -- we will always use 1 for this
	parameter.
